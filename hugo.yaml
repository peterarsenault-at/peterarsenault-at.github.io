      - text: "Dr. Jake McCoy and Peter Arsenault met in 2008 in the freshman astronomy dorm at UMass Amherst. "
      - text: "Dr. McCoy's experiences in the Penn State Nanofabrication Laboratory Since 2016 have shaped him into a solutions-driven nanofabrication consultant, optics researcher, and foremost expert in electron-beam lithography."
      - text: "Mr. Arsenault's experiences in the State Penn have taught him the street knowledge needed to succeed in the ruthless world of business. He handles everything outside of the lab."
      - text: "We want to partner with you to produce the diffraction gratings needed for your next project. Our goal is to design and deliver custom diffraction gratings at competitive rates. We want to help your projects come to life."

      - text: "As an Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and faculty member of the McEntaffer Group for Nanofabrication and Astronomical Instrumentation at Penn State, Dr. McCoy is a designated super-user of the nanofabrication lab. He will work with you to determine the best processes for developing your materials, as well as testing, characterizing, and imaging them before shipping."
      - text: "Dr. McCoy has experience in many standard deposition, growth, etching, charactarization, and lithography technologies. His manufacturing expertise is in using electron-beam lithography to produce blazed reflection gratings. His research interests include increasing the efficency and resolution of diffraction gratings using e-beam lithography."
